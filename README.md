Hunter College Class C++ Projects
In the following projects, assigned by my Professor Stewart Weiss, was designed to expose his students to large open data sets (no one has propriety rights to the data and can be downloaded and analyze for free). These projects also require the students to implement and use their own data structures, such as binary search trees, rather than the ones provided by the C++ STL.

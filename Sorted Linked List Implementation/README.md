Wi-Fi Hotspot Locations and Sorted Linked List
************************************************************
This project is designed to retrieve information about NYC Wi-Fi Hotspot Locations from:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw. <br />

I implemented a class to represent each hotspot location as an object. <br />
Then I implemented a sorted linked list template to store all those objects. <br />
The commands (written by Professor Weiss) is use to preform various functions on the open data set. For example, one can search up a the number of Wi-Fi Hotspot locations near by if given GPS (longitude and latitude) location and the range or distance.

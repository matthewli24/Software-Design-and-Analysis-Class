This project is designed to retrieve information about NYC Wi-Fi Hotspot Locations from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw. \n
I implemented a class to represent each hotspot location as an object. \n
Then I implemented a sorted linked list template to store all those objects. \n
